# Pymarad
Collection of tutorials/projects from all fields of life using high-shool math solved with the help of Python, not only for the high school students.

## If you do not have Python installed
No worries, [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks online.

in **GitHub repository name or URL** field
copy the following:

`https://github.com/palec87/pymarad` 

and press launch.

It takes some time, but eventually Jupyter environment loads and in the left-hand side panel, you will be able to browse folders containing all the projects, as well as the introductory Notebooks.

## List of projects available up to date (alphabetical)
### Fully working
* Probability
    1. Pee in the sea
        * You pee in the ocean and you perfectly mix everything. Then you draw a glass of water out of the ocean, how many pee molecules will you find?
        * Chemistry, Avogadro constant, isotopes, binomial (hypergeometrical) distribution, unit conversion, for loops in Python, scipy.stats module
* Quadratic equation
  1. Intro NB
        * Basic properties of quadratic function
        * graph, apex, discriminant, intersection, focus.
  2. Buying Pizza
        * When does it pay of to buy 2 smaller pizzas rather than 1 bigger one?
        * Compare sizes of pizzas, solving quad. equation, define functions in Python, fsolve(), plotting graphs.
  3. Selling lemonade
        * Calculate your profits based on the demand curve for your product, investment cost etc.
        * Economics, demand curve, quadratic function, interpolation of functions.
* Sets
  1. Forest fires and arson
        * You are trying identify countries soft on arson crime. If you convince them to step up, you can save lots of CO<sub>2</sub>, lives and money.
        * Ecology, forest fires, arson, GDP per capita, pandas module, set operations, Venn diagrams.

### Under development
* Goniometry
  1. Intro to Fourier transform
        * Approximation of a square wave with sine functions.
        * Interactive plotting with plotly. 
  2. Create a new musical instrument:
        * How come that even though a tone is a single wave, you can recognize instrument which plays it?
        * Find out what gives instruments their timbre and based on that create your own new instrument sound.
        * Music, sine function, physics of waves, Fourier transform, frequency vs. time
* Vectors
  1. Diet analyzer
        * Compare diets in terms of how much calories they give? Are they sustainable, what about your diet? Is it possible to feed all people in the world like that?
        * Food security, water/land consumption, vectors and vector spaces.
